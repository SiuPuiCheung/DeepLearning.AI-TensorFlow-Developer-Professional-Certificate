# DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer-Professional-Certificate


This repository contains my assignment solutions for the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) offered on Coursera. The certificate program consists of four courses designed to help learners develop deep learning applications using TensorFlow, Google's powerful open-source software library for machine learning.

## Courses

The Professional Certificate is divided into four courses, each focusing on a different aspect of TensorFlow and deep learning. Below is a brief overview of the courses and the assignments contained within this repository:

### 1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

### 3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

### 4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

## Installation and Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) in this repository, you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. If you do not have Jupyter installed, you can install it by following the instructions on [Jupyter's installation documentation](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once Jupyter is installed, clone this repository to your local machine:
